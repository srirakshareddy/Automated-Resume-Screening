# Deep Learning-driven Automated Resume Screening for Human Capital Hiring

Automated text categorization has traditionally been seen as an essential technique for managing and processing a huge volume of widely used digital documents. This category of online content, sometimes referred to as digital or electronic information, includes documents, conference materials, publications, journals, editorials, web pages, e-mails, etc. Instead of only using antiquated paper sources like books, periodicals, and newspapers, people increasingly acquire knowledge online. However, the fundamental issue is that this vast amount of unorganized information is challenging to handle. One of the most critical methods for managing this sort of digital data is text categorization. This project proposes a Deep Learning-driven Automated Resume Screening approach for Human Capital Hiring. The system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract features from resumes and then employs BERT and DistillBERT transformers to classify them into relevant job categories and then uses Graph Neural Networks to summarize the classified resumes to find a ranking of the best resumes for required Job Description (JD) while eliminating bias between similarity in resumes and JDs. The system is trained on multiple resume and job description datasets, ensuring its ability to handle a wide range of job categories. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy in screening resumes, reducing the workload of human recruiters and minimizing bias in the hiring process. The experimental results show that the system outperforms traditional resume screening methods and can provide valuable insights into the hiring process.
